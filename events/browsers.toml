title="Chrome pre-defined Custom Handlers for IPFS"
description="High-level overview of the refactoring Implemented in Chrome's source code to define a dedicated component for the Custom Handlers logic. Thanks to this refactoring, we have improved the support for Chrome embedders to implement their own pre-defined Custom Handlers for the schemes they consider strategic. Patching Chrome to add a pre-defined Custom Handler to manage IPFS schemes is now trivial, reducing considerably the efforts of embedders to deal with rebases in order to sync with Chrome upstream."
